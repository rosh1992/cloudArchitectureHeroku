##Kickstarter is the worldâ€™s largest crowdfunding platform. The application that we have created for this project allows the user to query from a dataset of more than 300,000 kickstarter projects. The cloud technology we have used to access the dataset for the back end was Apache Spark, while Angular 4 framework was used to create the web application at the front end.

##The back end application is hosted on AWS whihch runs a jar file and accepts requests from the client which is running on the heroku app.
